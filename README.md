# 🍺 Brewing Tools

This repository is dedicated to developing tools for brewing beer! The project will go through a few stages, starting with simple Python scripts, evolving into a fully-fledged app, and eventually exploring automated brewing solutions. Cheers! 🎉

## 🛠️ Project Stages

1. **Stage 1** - Develop basic Python scripts as demos for testing brewing tools in real brewing situations. ⚗️
2. **Stage 2** - Build an app based on the tested scripts to streamline the brewing process. 📲
3. **Stage 3** - Experiment with automation to optimize and simplify the brewing workflow. 🤖

Happy brewing! 🍻
